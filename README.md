# Ex-4.-Scenario-Based-Report-Development-Utilizing-Diverse-Prompting-Techniques
Objective: The goal of this experiment is to design and develop an AI-powered chatbot that can handle customer inquiries, provide support, and improve customer experience in a retail environment. Create prompts using various AI prompting techniques to guide your experiment, data collection, analysis, and report creation.
## Aim: 
To evaluate how diverse AI prompting techniques can be applied to create an effective scenario-based customer service chatbot for a retail environment, and to compare the quality of responses generated through these different prompting methods.
## Algorithm: 
Step 1: Identify Retail Chatbot Use Cases

 - Product Information Inquiry

 - Order Tracking

 - Return & Refund Requests

 - Promotion/Discount Information

 - Store Policies & Location Guidance

Step 2: Select Prompting Techniques

 - Zero-shot prompting

 - One-shot prompting

 - Few-shot prompting

 - Role-based prompting

 - Persona-driven prompting

 - Instruction-based prompting

 - Chain-of-thought prompting

 - Socratic prompting

Step 3: Design Prompts
Frame realistic customer queries for each use case and apply multiple prompting styles.

Step 4: Execute Prompts
Test prompts across AI models (ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, Cohere Command, Meta AI).

Step 5: Collect Outputs
Document chatbot responses generated using different prompting styles.

Step 6: Evaluate Responses
Assess based on:
 - Clarity

 - Accuracy

 - Empathy

 - Personalization

 - Problem-solving effectiveness

Step 7: Compare Techniques
Highlight advantages, disadvantages, and ideal use cases for each technique.

Step 8: Conclude
Recommend a hybrid prompting framework for optimal retail chatbot performance.
## Prompt:
The purpose of this experiment is to design and implement an AI-driven chatbot tailored for retail settings. The chatbot should be capable of managing customer queries, offering assistance, and enhancing the overall shopping experience. As part of the study, prompts will be crafted using different AI prompting strategies to support the experiment design, data gathering, analytical evaluation, and structured report development. The final output should be compiled into a well-formatted PDF report spanning 3â€“5 pages.

## Result:
The experiment successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of prompt engineering in building an AI-powered chatbot for retail customer support. By applying diverse prompting strategies, the chatbot was able to:
Zero-shot prompting showed the baseline ability of the model but often produced generic responses.
Few-shot prompting improved accuracy for repetitive tasks such as order tracking and return requests.
Scenario-based prompting generated contextually rich and empathetic replies, enhancing customer trust.
Instruction-based prompting ensured consistency with company policies, especially in handling sensitive issues like refunds and complaints.
Chain-of-thought prompting allowed the chatbot to reason step-by-step in complex queries such as troubleshooting or personalized recommendations.
Hybrid prompting (scenario + reasoning) produced the most balanced performance, combining contextual depth with accuracy.
